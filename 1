  I'm a graduate student at RIMS, Kyoto. I am interested in mathematical and real physics. 
  When I was an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona, I did some research about soliton solutions and the Hirota method with Prof. V.E. Zakharov. 
  In particular, I constructed the periodic wave solution to the KP equation via the Theta function and Hirota method. 
  If you are interested in it, please contact me. I will be happy to share my calculations.
